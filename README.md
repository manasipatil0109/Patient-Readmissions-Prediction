# Patient-Readmissions-Prediction
This project is a machine learning pipeline that predicts hospital readmissions using a large healthcare dataset. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using multiple supervised learning approaches. The goal is to identify high-risk patients early and support better healthcare decisions through ML outputs.
